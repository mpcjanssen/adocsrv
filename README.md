# adocsrv

Serve local asciidoc files using Asciidoctor.

It is possible to:

- Preview the files using asciidoctor with diagram support
- Present the files using reveal.js
- Edit the files using gvim


*NB: This server runs asciidoctor locally and shows local files, so you probably don't want to open this to the internet*
